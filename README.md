# BasketballRecruiter
This project is a game where you will be a college basketball coach. You will be able to recruit players to your fictional school and simulate a season. The recruits available will be based on your school's academics, program prestige, fanbase, tv exposure, and league. It will also be based on your coach prestige and playstyle.

This project is built in Visual Studio using the C# programming language and .Net 6.0 framework with the MVC model. It also uses SQL for the school and player databases.
New players to be recruited will be created every season. The database will be read to get the available players. Team database fields will be updated based on the program's success and the user's settings. Unrecruited players will be deleted every year.
